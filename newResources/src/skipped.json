The team scrutinized all the hindrances that were accountable for the low standard of education in the walled city and started working on eradication of such deterrents for students. The fundamental aim of this organization is to improve the educational values/standards of the historical walled city. The society is engaged in the promotion of the education and social development and upliftment of the people belonging to the lower-income group, irrespective of any sex, creed, religion, caste or class. DYWA takes several sincere steps to sensitize and enlighten the masses towards the significance of education not only to equip the underprivileged sections of the society but also to provide the wings to unleash all their shackles. Our association has adopted 15 children and has financed their studies completely so that financial crunches cannot hamper their aspirations to achieve their goals in life. As a part of its customary practice, DYWA distributes free course material, provides coaching and educational assistance, facilitates the students to opt for the best career option by providing career counselling sessions and also provides constant motivation and encouragement to the children.
